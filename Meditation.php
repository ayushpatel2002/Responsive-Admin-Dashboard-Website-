                <h3>1) Mindfulness Meditation</h4>
                    The most common meditation practice in the West is mindfulness meditation, which is based on Buddhist teachings.
                    <br> <br> In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.
                    <br>
                    This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.
                    <br>
                    This sort of meditation is helpful for people who don't have access to an instructor because it can be done alone.

                Monks suggests that the easiest way to begin is to sit quietly and focus on your breath till at least 20 minutes.<br> <br>
                Its benefits includes: -
                <ul>
                    <li>Spiritual meditation releases and settles our thoughts and emotions</li>

                    <li>It helps you to let go of the past and sink in peace</li>
                </ul>

                </video>
                Any of the 5 senses are required to perform this kind of meditation.<br><br>
                For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention. Also, you can try counting mala beads, listening to a gong, or staring at a candle flame.<br>
                This looks quite simple but it is difficult for beginners to concentrate longer than a few minutes. <br>
                If your mind does wander, it’s important to come back to the practice and refocus.<br>
                As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who requires additional focus in their life.
                <br><br>
                Practicing this can help in reduce your stress and anxiety and at the same time it helps in enhancing one's self awareness.<br>
                Also, this helps in increasing concentration span of a person which helps when you are doing some sort of work as small things now does not distract or break your concentration.

                <h3>4) Movement Meditation</h3>
                Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include walking through the woods, gardening, qigong, and other gentle forms of motion.<br><br>
                It’s an active form of meditation where the movement guides you.<br>

                <h3> 5) Mantra Meditation</h3>
                Many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions, emphasize mantra meditation. To clear the mind, this style of meditation uses a repeated sound.

                <audio controls><source src="Media/Om.mp3"></audio><br>
